import checkboxAnatomy from '../components/checkbox-anatomy'

The `checkbox` element is a control that allows the user to select a binary state, either checked or unchecked.

## Anatomy

### Diagram

<SelectAnatomy />

### Part Definitions

`::host` — Root element that contains the individual control and label.

`::part-checkbox` — The checkbox control accepting and displaying the state of the checkbox.

`::part-checked-indicator` — The element indicating the checked state of the checkbox.

`::part-indeterminate-indicator` — element indicating the indeterminate state of the checkbox.

`::part-label` — The text-based label of the checkbox.

### Events

- `::host` Listening for `toggle-pop-up` event to hide/show `::part-pop-up`

- `::part-button` Listens to `click` event and dispatches `toggle-pop-up` event

- `::part-button` Listening for `option-change` event to update selected value shown

- `::part-pop-up` Listening for `option-change` event to dispatch `toggle-pop-up` event

- `::part-button` Dispatches custom event `split-button-clicked`

## Accessibility

### Keyboard

Keyboard users can operate the `<select>` as follows:

- Focus on the `<select>` element using the `Tab` key (there is a tab stop on `part-button`). The control can be
  focused by default by setting the `autofocus` attribute.
- Having focus, but with the pop-up still closed, users can:
  - Change the selection to the next option using the `Down` arrow
  - Change the selection to the previous option using the `Up` arrow
  - Change the selection to the first option starting with a certain sequence by typing that sequence
  - Cycle the selection through options starting with a certain letter by continually typing that letter
- Having focus, the user can open the popup using the `Enter` key or the `Space` key. The popup can be dismissed using
  the `Enter` key or the `Esc` key.
- Having focus and with the pop-up open, the user can select options in the same manner as above. As the user traverses
  the options, the currently-selected option is always visible and highlighted, with the menu scrolling as necessary.
- Upon selection, the select control's `value` field is updated to the respective option's `value` accordingly.

### Assistive Technology

Implements the [combobox role](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.1/#role-map-combobox) per the
[HTML AAM spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#html-element-role-mappings).

### Forced Colors

Placeholder for now, dependent on standardization on parts definitions.

## States / Properties

  "Auto" is the behavior of `<select>` today (pop up in the direction with the most screen real estate).

- **repeatScroll** (_bool_): Specify whether, while using arrow keys, the menu should scroll back to the first option
  after reaching the last option.
